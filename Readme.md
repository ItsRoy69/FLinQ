Few Instructions:

- Naming format of folders should be in "smallcase"

- Used tailwind for consistent styling, if any component has styling which are not needed in other files/pages then use the "name.css" to include the css property tehre, other styles which are same in all componenets should be included and modified inside "index.css"

- Naming format of jsx files should be in "PascalCase"
